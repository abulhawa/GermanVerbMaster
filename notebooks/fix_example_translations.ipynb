Unlike in Germany, however, the Dutch informal you does not imply any particular familiarity; it's more comparable to the English you. In business dealings, it is customary to start addressing each other with the informal you without any prior notice, in the middle of a conversation. (...) Being on first-name terms does not signal that people have become closer in any way, that they find the other person likeable, or that they'll negotiate any less toughly. Especially between Germans and Dutch there often arise misunderstandings in this respect. If, for example, a manager allows himself to be addressed using the informal you, Germans tend to interpret this as a sign of a particularly good work environment, whereas the informal you is simply a conventional way of addressing people.\",\n",
