# Personas and Learner Journeys

This document updates the primary personas and end-to-end journeys for GermanVerbMaster based on September 2025 interviews and support tickets. Each persona includes the north-star outcomes, motivations, friction points, and the critical journey stages to inform roadmap prioritisation.

## Persona 1: Structured Self-Starter
- **Profile:** Late-20s professional working in consulting, studies German four nights per week to qualify for an internal relocation programme.
- **Motivation:** Wants repeatable drills that fit into short blocks and prove steady progress that can be shared with a mentor.
- **Top Goals:** Hit B1 speaking certification within six months, maintain a 10-day streak, and understand weak verb families at a glance.
- **Frictions:** Gets overwhelmed by large verb lists, struggles to translate analytics into “what do I review next?”, frequently hops between laptop and mobile.
- **Success Signals:** Consistent adaptive queue that surfaces 15–20 verbs per session, weekly digest showing accuracy trend, and ability to sync progress across devices.

### Journey Map
| Stage | Questions | Moments of Truth | Opportunities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discover | Will this app help me prepare for certification efficiently? | Preview of adaptive practice and streak tracking. | Create product marketing pages highlighting adaptive engine and multi-device sync. |
| Onboard | How quickly can I import my existing study plan? | First-run setup that maps verb levels and sets weekly goals. | Offer templated plans (A1 fast track, consultancy relocation) and import from CSV/Anki. |
| Practice | What should I review tonight? | Adaptive queue that justifies each verb and shows time estimate. | Launch focus mode, progress heatmap, and “next 3 wins” coaching. |
| Reflect | Am I still on track to relocate? | Weekly email digest with streak, accuracy slope, and verb families needing attention. | Add downloadable report for mentor check-ins and integration with calendar reminders. |

## Persona 2: Immersive University Learner
- **Profile:** 19-year-old exchange student in Munich, studying business full time while working part time. Alternates between smartphone commuting sessions and laptop study groups.
- **Motivation:** Needs engaging, multimodal practice to survive oral exams and blend into local campus life.
- **Top Goals:** Improve listening comprehension for lectures, reduce pronunciation mistakes during presentations, keep backlog manageable during exam weeks.
- **Frictions:** Audio drills feel repetitive, little feedback on pronunciation, analytics page is not contextual enough, limited offline support on U-Bahn rides.
- **Success Signals:** Listening mode that caches prompts, pronunciation scoring with actionable tips, and contextual quests aligning verbs to classroom scenarios.

### Journey Map
| Stage | Questions | Moments of Truth | Opportunities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discover | Is this app less boring than flashcards? | Demo of audio drills and pattern quests. | Promote multimodal practice (listening, speaking, context quests) on landing pages. |
| Onboard | Can I start on the tram with low connectivity? | Offline-first setup flow confirming cached lessons. | Simplify install prompts, highlight download queue, and surface privacy assurances. |
| Practice | Will this help me pass the oral midterm? | Pronunciation scoring with suggestions after every attempt. | Pair speaking drills with example clips and allow quick retries with progress feedback. |
| Reflect | How can I focus before exams? | Analytics filtered by exam topic with recommended verb packs. | Provide “exam sprint” preset and shareable study capsules for classmates. |

## Persona 3: Secondary School Teacher
- **Profile:** 45-year-old German teacher running two 30-student classes, needs to report outcomes to administrators and parents.
- **Motivation:** Wants a dashboard that surfaces struggling students quickly and automates weekly homework assignments.
- **Top Goals:** Track accuracy by student cohort, assign verb packs aligned with curriculum, export progress for parent-teacher conferences.
- **Frictions:** Manual tracking in spreadsheets, difficulty nudging students to practise outside class, limited collaboration features.
- **Success Signals:** Dashboard that flags at-risk students, templated assignments, and aggregated analytics per class.

### Journey Map
| Stage | Questions | Moments of Truth | Opportunities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discover | Does this tool save me planning time? | Demo of teacher dashboard with assignment wizard. | Provide educator-specific landing and quick-start guide. |
| Onboard | How do I invite my two classes? | Class roster import and parent consent workflow. | Offer CSV import, email templates for guardians, and privacy overview. |
| Practice | Are students keeping up between lessons? | Live roster showing streaks and missed work. | Enable automated reminders, badge incentives, and integration with school LMS. |
| Reflect | Can I justify results to administrators? | Exportable report with class averages and verb mastery. | Generate CEFR-aligned report packs and sync to gradebook systems. |

## Key Implications for Roadmap
- Phase 1 adaptive features must explain “why this verb” for professionals while remaining playful for students.
- Phase 2 multimodal work should emphasise offline-first caching and personalised pronunciation coaching.
- Phase 3 dashboards need privacy-compliant roster management, aligning with teacher persona expectations.
- Baseline KPIs must segment by persona proxies (device type, practice mode) to track impact over time.
