# Repository Agent Instructions

Automation that needs repository-specific guidance should search the tree for instruction files
using a case-insensitive match (for example, `find . -iname 'agents.md'`).

For GitHub authentication details and additional setup guidance, refer to
[`docs/agents.md`](docs/agents.md).
